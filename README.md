🔹 TASK–1: ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT (ALU)

Description:
This task involves designing a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The ALU is a fundamental component of a processor responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. The designed ALU supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT**. A selector signal is used to choose the required operation. The functionality of the ALU is verified using a Verilog testbench and simulation, ensuring correct output for different input combinations.

🔹 TASK–2: RAM DESIGN

Description:
In this task, a simple synchronous Random Access Memory (RAM) module is designed using Verilog. The RAM supports both read and write operations controlled by a clock signal and a write enable signal. The memory stores data at specified addresses and outputs data synchronously with the clock. A testbench is used to demonstrate successful data writing and reading operations, validating the correct behavior of the RAM design through simulation.

🔹 TASK–3: PIPELINED PROCESSOR DESIGN

Description:
This task focuses on designing a 4-stage pipelined processor using Verilog HDL. The processor is divided into four stages: Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), and Write Back (WB). It supports basic instructions such as ADD, SUB, and LOAD. Pipeline registers are used between stages to allow parallel execution of instructions, improving performance. Simulation results demonstrate the flow of instructions through each pipeline stage.

🔹 TASK–4: DIGITAL FILTER DESIGN (FIR FILTER)

Description:
In this task, a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filter is designed and simulated using Verilog. The FIR filter processes digital input signals using a fixed set of coefficients to produce a filtered output. A multi-tap FIR structure is implemented using shift registers and adders. The filter’s functionality is verified through simulation by applying sample input signals and observing the filtered output, demonstrating noise reduction and signal smoothing characteristics.
