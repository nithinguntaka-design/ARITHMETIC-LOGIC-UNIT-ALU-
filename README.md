🔹 TASK–1: ARITHMETIC LOGIC UNIT (ALU)

Description:
This task involves designing a basic Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Verilog HDL. The ALU is a fundamental component of a processor responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations. The designed ALU supports basic operations such as addition, subtraction, AND, OR, and NOT. A selector signal is used to choose the required operation. The functionality of the ALU is verified using a Verilog testbench and simulation, ensuring correct output for different input combinations.
